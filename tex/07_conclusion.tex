\section{Limitations}
Predator:
1. the key point is not very accurate 
2. no coarse matching, are not fully leveraging the feature matching at coarse level

PCAccumulation:
1. fully supervised methods, how to scale up to huge unlabeled datasets 
2. how to spot and alleviate the domain gap

NFL:
1. handle the adverse weather

DyNFL:
1. jointly optimise the poses to account for inaccurate object detection results 
2. 


\section{Outlook}
Looking into the future, there are various research fronts that we can advance: 

1. Multi-body dynamics reconstruction
    1. leverage the vison foundation models, to scale up the multi-body dynamic reconstruction
    2. one 3D backbone for most of the point cloud data 
2. neural simulation:
    1. how to integrate the learned shape priors to amid partial reconstruction 
    2. how to additionally model the adverse weather in the inverse problem 
    3. a scalable neural reconstruction that can circumvent the time-consuming optimisation, at least to some extent
3. apply matching to neural representations
    1. our gaussian splatting loop closure can be seen as one attempt on this front
