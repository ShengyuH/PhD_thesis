    \caption{Improved relative overlap ratio after filtering the points with the inferred overlap scores on 8862 \textit{ModelNet} partial scans(\textit{left}). Owing to the improved overlap ratio, \acro\ is robust to the changes of partial value $p_v$, while the performance of RPM-Net drops rapidly (\textit{right}).  \textit{rand} and \textit{prob.} denote the random and \emph{prob. (om)} biased sampling of 450 interest points, respectively.}%
