   Qualitative results on \textit{Waymo Dynamic} dataset. Our model equipped with a ray drop module effectively composites multiple neural fields, re-simulating LiDAR scans of high quality.

   % \caption{These figures exemplify the effectiveness of our field composition method leveraging ray drop probability from dynamic neural field. When all intersected rays are rendered for the dynamic neural field, noticeable artifacts appear due to disturbances from irrelevant fields (middle figure). The figures on the right showcase the complete composition method.
