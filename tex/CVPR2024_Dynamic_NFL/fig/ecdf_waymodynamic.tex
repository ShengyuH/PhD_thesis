The left diagram represents the ECDF for all LiDAR measurements, while the right diagram represents the ECDF for measurements on dynamic vehicles only.}
        \caption{ECDF plots showcasing range errors across all the points (left) and specifically for points associated with dynamic vehicles (right). Our neural fields composition demonstrates superior performance over LiDARsim~\cite{manivasagam2020lidarsim} and UniSim~\cite{yang2023unisim}, especially in the context of dynamic vehicles.}
