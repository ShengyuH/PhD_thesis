    % \caption{The middle figure showcase the trajectory manipulation application on the moving truck. The images are color-coded by the intensity values (0 \bwrDyNFL~0.25). The object detection results on the LiDAR scan after manipulation is shown on the right, we annotate the points in \textcolor{orange}{orange} if they are within the detection bounding boxes.}
