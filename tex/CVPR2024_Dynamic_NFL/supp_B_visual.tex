   \caption{Visualization of scene editing capabilities. We showcase 3 kinds of scene editing capabilities including vehicle removal(left), trajectory manipulation(middle) and vehicle insertion(right). The first row represents the original scenes, the second row demonstrates the scenes after editing. All points are color-coded by the intensity values(0 ~\bwrDyNFL~ 0.25).}

\section{More qualitative results}\label{sec:sup_visual}
In this section, we provide more qualitative results. In \cref{fig:4_scenes_supp}, we showcase the 4 scenes from \textit{Waymo dynamic} dataset. We show additional scene editing results in~\cref{fig:scene_editing_supp}. Please check the supplementary videos for more qualitative results.
