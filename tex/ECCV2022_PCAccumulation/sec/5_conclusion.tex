\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusions}
We have looked at the analysis of 3D point cloud sequences from a fresh viewpoint, as point cloud accumulation across time. In that view we integrate point cloud registration, motion segmentation, instance segmentation, and piece-wise rigid scene flow estimation into a complete multi-frame 4D scene analysis method. By jointly considering sequences of frames, our model is able to disentangle scene dynamics and recover accurate instance-level rigid-body motions. The model processes (ordered) raw point clouds, and can operate online with low latency. A major \emph{limitation} is that our approach is fully supervised and heavily relies on annotated data: it requires instance-level segmentations as well as ground truth motions, although we demonstrate some robustness to label noise from interpolated pseudo ground truth. Also, our system consists of multiple processing stages and cannot fully recover from mistakes in early stages, like incorrect motion segmentation. 

In \emph{future work} we hope to explore our method's potential for downstream scene understanding tasks. We also plan to extend it to an incremental setting, where longer sequences of frames can be summarized into our holistic, dynamic scene representation in an online fashion.
