\caption{The range accuracy of the LiDAR sensor is affected by waveform discretization and beam divergence. %
The LiDAR sensor has a tendency to overestimate range in high incidence angle regime, which becomes increasingly pronounced at higher range regimes (left). This is also reflected on \textit{TownReal} dataset (right).}
